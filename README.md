**Simple Calculator – Manual Test Cases**
**Project Overview**

This repository contains manual test cases written for testing a web-based Simple Calculator application.
The test cases are designed to validate the correctness of basic arithmetic operations and to ensure proper handling of valid and invalid user inputs.

**Application Under Test**
